#
# Shares store the processed identity permissions for posts. 
#
# post_id: the post being permissioned
#
# identity_provider_id: the ID of the identity type this share is. 
# Identities types are described in the IdentityProvider model.
# Each identity type has its own validators and formatters.
# 
# identity_pair: the processed identity and the associated identity provider ID
# are brought together into a pair in this column so all shares can be found
# in the same place.
#
# can_show: indicates that requests bearing the attached identity can view the
# content with the post_id
#
# can_destroy: indicates that requests bearing the attached identity can 
# destroy the content with the post_id
#
# can_update: indicates that requests bearing the attached identity can 
# update the content with the post_id
#
# can_share: indicates that requests bearing the attached identity can 
# give others permissions on the content. People with sharing permission
# can grant sharing, updating, destruction, and viewing permission to any
# identity.
