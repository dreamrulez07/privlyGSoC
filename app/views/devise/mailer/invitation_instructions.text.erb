Hello <%= @resource.email %>!

Someone has invited you to <%= root_url %>, you can accept it through the link below. Make sure you read this entire email before using the Privly Project.

We recommend you watch the overview video (https://vimeo.com/83073455) and if you are technically minded, technical video (https://vimeo.com/83258935).

Warning: Software in Alpha testing is not secure. If you want to use Privly with private data, you should wait until the Beta release. We are opening this server for accounts so users can influence the development of the system. When you find a problem, make sure you report the bug (<%= pages_bug_url %>) so we can fix the problem for you.

How to Use:
1. Visit and complete the forms -> <%= accept_invitation_url(@resource, :invitation_token => @resource.invitation_token) %>
2. Download the extension for your browser: https://priv.ly/pages/download.html
3. Restart your browser
4. Right-click on a form that you want to post Privly-type content to
5. Select the Privly Application you want to post with (ZeroBin, PlainPost, etc)
6. Submit the Privly App's form
7. Submit the form on the page

    Thanks for the Support, and let us know how it goes!
